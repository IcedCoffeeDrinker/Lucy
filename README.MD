## Testing / Local Deployment
Use Docker for local development. Install the docker engine first, then proceed.
For local deployment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IcedCoffeeDrinker/Lucy.git
cd Lucy
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
Then in a seperate terminal:
```bash
# Execute any test by running them with python3. You may have to install additional dependencies.
# Example:
python3 src/services/faster_whisper_api/tests/test_live_transcription.py
# most tests use dynamic paths, so you can execute them from anywhere
```


## Project State
Currently working:
- `database_api`
- `ollama_api`
- `twilio_api`
- `faster_whisper_api`

Ollama speaks to my local server and isn't set up to work with local ollama files yet. A migration from `pip` to `poetry` is planned.
